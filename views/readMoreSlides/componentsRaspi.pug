        | Creator Eben Upton's goal was to create a low-cost device that would improve programming skills and hardware understanding at the pre-university level. 
      li.card1-minor-bullet
        | But thanks to its small size and accessible price, it was quickly adopted by tinkerers, 
        | makers, and electronics enthusiasts for projects that require more than a basic microcontroller (such as Arduino devices).
      li.card1-minor-bullet
        | The Raspberry Pi is slower than a modern laptop or desktop but is still a complete 
        | Linux computer and can provide all the expected abilities that implies, at a low-power consumption level.
    h5.card1-major-bullet
      | Processor speed ranges from 700 MHz to 1.4 GHz for the Pi 3 Model B+; on-board memory ranges from 256 MB to 1 GB RAM.

        | Secure Digital (SD) cards are used to store the operating system and program memory in either SDHC or MicroSDHC sizes. 
      li.card1-minor-bullet
        | The boards have one to four USB ports. For video output, HDMI and composite video are supported, 
        | with a standard 3.5 mm phono jack for audio output. 
      li.card1-minor-bullet
        | Lower-level output is provided by a number of 
        | GPIO pins which support common protocols like IÂ²C. 
      li.card1-minor-bullet
        | The B-models have an 8P8C Ethernet port and the 
        | Pi 3 and Pi Zero W have on-board Wi-Fi 802.11n and Bluetooth. 
      li.card1-minor-bullet
        | Prices range from US$5 to $35.
